✨ The IBM Financial Analysis Assistant accepts user input queries at two distinct levels ✨

**Design-based analysis**
<br/> Users submit company annual reports without a specific idea in mind. The system analyzes the provided references to generate built-in analysis and produce visualizations.

**Detailed Idea Description**
<br/> Users provide comprehensive descriptions of their specific research ideas. The system processes these detailed inputs to develop implementation strategies based on the user's explicit requirements.
